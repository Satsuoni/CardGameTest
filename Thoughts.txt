Effect stack?
Step 1: Determine which effects still work - in order of addition
Note: effects are not destroyed by effects, though may be prevented from being applied
Effects that affect other effects have SCOPE_EFFECT tag
Step 2: Apply effects in loop, from older to newer, until no new effects can be applied

How do I check for conditions?
