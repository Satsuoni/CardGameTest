Effect stack?
Step 1: Determine which effects still work - in order of addition
Note: effects are not destroyed by effects, though may be prevented from being applied
Effects that affect other effects have SCOPE_EFFECT tag
Step 2: Apply effects in loop, from older to newer, until no new effects can be applied

How do I check for conditions?

Do I write a simple language?
How is a card played?
1. choosing: effects that prevent objects from being chosen? Should be external to data, I guess. With possible additional conditions.
condition selectable left_arm_transformcard?
you can play card or ability
Ability is like a card thing
parametric conditionals..., with ellipsis (for tags)

Triggerable one-shots?

On-dismiss effects?
Do we allow additional refs after definition? in conditionals,etc
//let's say I want : if life played on right hand, move card to discard
conditional=effect
Atomic instruction blocks! _target
 _execute
